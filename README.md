# *Roadmap*

Micro Services projects goal, architecture and to do list

This project is inspired by [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/),
[Pattern: Microservice Architecture](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) and
my own experience of developing enterprise applications.
